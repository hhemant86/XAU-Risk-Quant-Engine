Sentinel Prime v2.0
Institutional Risk Governance Engine

AI Sentiment Integration · Quantitative Regime Control · Behavioral Guardrails

📌 Executive Summary

Sentinel Prime v2.0 is an institutional-grade risk governance system designed to operate above trading strategies rather than replace them.
It enforces capital preservation, behavioral discipline, and regime awareness by synchronizing quantitative volatility telemetry with AI-driven sentiment intelligence.

The system is architected for high-stress, high-volatility environments where human judgment degrades faster than markets.

This is not a backtesting toy, signal generator, or retail trading bot.
It is a governance layer.

🏛️ Governance Philosophy

Markets fail slowly. Humans fail suddenly.

Sentinel Prime exists to:

Detect regime instability

Validate price action against narrative

Enforce non-negotiable behavioral constraints

Produce forensic-grade audit trails

Every decision is logged.
Every override is visible.
Every anomaly is explainable.

🧠 Core Architecture
1. Market Regime Classification

Rolling statistical analysis using volatility, Z-scores, and dispersion metrics

Regimes classified into:

NEUTRAL

STRESS

ANOMALY

2. AI Sentiment Divergence Engine (R&D Layer)

FinBERT-based NLP sentiment analysis

Detects “Ghost Moves”:

Large price volatility unsupported by news sentiment

Escalates governance state when narrative confirmation fails

3. Behavioral Guardrails

Embedded Biological Circuit Breaker

Monitors consecutive anomalies and stress persistence

Enforces mandatory cognitive cooldown locks

Prevents emotional over-trading during drawdown clusters

4. Institutional Quorum Validation

Multi-source macro and geopolitical confirmation

Sources include structured financial and commodity news feeds

Reduces single-source narrative risk
